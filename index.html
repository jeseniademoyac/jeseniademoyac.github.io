		<p class="text">Yadiris Marte, 42, is a Dominican mother of three. During the first three days of the month, she visits the nearest supermarket -across Saint Nicholas Avenue- to buy groceries for the following 30 days, including four packs of 16.9 full onzes of water bottles with 40 units each. "These are $9.56. It's cheap!", Marte comments on the financial cost for each pack this single mom uses to prepare meals and to drink at home. </p>
		<p class="text">But how does she get them to thier three bedroom apartment on a fourth floor with no elevator in Washington Heights? Sometimes, she pays an extra $5 to have someone bring them up. When the budget is tight, her teeanagers Yarisa Castillo, 19, and Dewald Castillo, 15, pay the price. "I have to cut on classes to come help mom get things done here, after I'm done at the store," says Yarisa Castillo, who works a part time job and is a nursing student at <a href="http://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/nursing/prospective-student/program.jsp">BMCC</a>.</p>
		<p class="text">Although New York is ranked as one of the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rodales-organic-life/the-top-10-tapwater-cities-in-america_b_8184138.html">Top 10 cities</a> with the best tap water supplies nation wide, most Latinos don't use it on a daily basis. Some Hispanics consider water to be safer to drink and use when taken out of a recently opened bottle.</p>
		<p class="text">Several scientific research studies suggest that African Americans and Hispanic Americans tend to purchase water filters and bottled water because of their cultural backgrounds.</p>
		<p class="text">"The preference of these minority groups are not driven by concerns about convenience, but rather perception about water quality," <a href="https://law.vanderbilt.edu/phd/faculty/w-kip-viscusi/341_The_Private_Rationality_of_Bottled_Water_Drinking.pdf">The Private Rationality of Bottled Water Drinking</a> study says. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, states with more water quality violations are more likely to drink bottled water. But, in Latino communities and Black neighborhoods this is not the case.</p>

		<p class="text">"While water quality is a big matter of concern to these groups, complaints in their communities -specially the Latino one- could be less often reported because they relay on buying or filtering water, because they don't have a habit on reporting these issues, or because they lack of information on how to do so," says Lourdes Tapia, scientist and member of the Dominican Academy of Sciences, resident of NYC.</p>
